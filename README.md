# hydroSIM: Super-resolution speckle illumination microscopy with a hydrogel diffuser
The reconstruction algorithm is for the paper titled **hydroSIM: Super-resolution speckle illumination microscopy with a hydrogel diffuser**.
<br>
### Dataset
The testing dataset is available at [https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Stack_tif/25665024](url) beacuse of the size limitation.
<br>
### Parameter    
The parameter to reproduce the Fig. 3 of our paper is pre-set in our code.
<br>


### Hardware and software requirements
1. Matlab R2022a is recommended since all the data in our paper is reconstructed using version of R2022a;
2. This algorithm is accelerated by GPU, and GPU better than GTX 1080 is recommended;

### Note
Please refer to our paper to obtain more details about the reconstruction process.
